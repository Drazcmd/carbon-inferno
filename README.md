![CarbonDoomsDay Logo](https://i.imgur.com/jfj3CMs.png)

A [create-react-app]  web application for visualising tracking CO2 emissions since 1958.

[create-react-app]: https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app

This application is part of the [Carbon Doomsday project]:

[Carbon Doomsday project]: http://datadrivenjournalism.net/featured_projects/carbon_doomsday_tracking_co2_since_1958

> Carbon Doomsday is a real-time API and chart of worldwide carbon dioxide
> levels. Developed as a community project, its goal is to be an open-source
> platform for climate data. Data for the API and chart comes from NOAAâ€™s Earth
> System Research Lab in Mauna Loa, Hawaii. The project is rooted in principles
> of free software, open data access and a willingness to contribute to further
> education on the global climate issue.

We pull our data from [api.carbondoomsday.com] while [giving a fuck].
